# Celeste windows linux-ifier

This repo contains a little script set up a celeste windows install so that it runs natively (with mono) instead of having to use wine or a derivative

# Usefulness

- Modding: modding a windows install doesn't work, but if you make it a linux install, it will
- Stability: Since it is run *almost* as the devs inteded it, probably its going to give a better experience
- Performance: it runs as any linux install, instead of being slowed down by windows compatibility layers

This script will be most useful for people stuck on the epic games version of Celeste, since thats the only one which doesn't provide a linux version.
